# noob_bash
A handful of bash scripts

## Scripts:

1. [Count Items](https://github.com/baduker/noob_bash/blob/master/scripts/ci.sh)
A simple script that counts the number of items (files) in a given folder.

2. [Simulate Typing](https://github.com/baduker/noob_bash/blob/master/scripts/sim.sh) A silly script that simulates typing (just like in the movies!)
