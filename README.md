## Scripts:

1. [Count Items](https://github.com/baduker/noob_bash/blob/master/scripts/ci.sh):
A simple script that counts the number of items (files) in a given folder.

2. [Simulate Typing](https://github.com/baduker/noob_bash/blob/master/scripts/sim.sh): A silly script that simulates typing (just like in the movies!).

3. [Up](https://github.com/baduker/noob_bash/blob/master/scripts/up.sh): A one-liner version of a combine `uptime` command.

## Usage:

You can run any of the scripts either from the directory they're located in or add them to your `PATH`. That way, a given script can be run from anywhere.

### Here's how to do it.

+ Remove the `.sh` extension first by running this command `mv a_script.sh a_script`.

+ Save the script in some directory, for example `~/bin`.

+ Add the `~/bin` to your `PATH` by typing `export PATH=$PATH:~/bin`.

+ Now you can run the script from anywhere!
